**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs involves using modular designs, clear naming conventions, and thorough documentation, as seen in the CRUD Python module from Project One; this approach made it easy to connect dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two, offered clear separation of concerns, and will allow the CRUD module to be reused in future projects or adapted to new requirements with minimal changes.

**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**

When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, I start by analyzing requirements, iteratively designing and testing solutions, and collaborating with stakeholders; for Grazioso Salvare's database and dashboard, this meant translating client needs into structured modules and clear interfacesâ€”an approach more focused on real-world integration and client priorities than some earlier, more academic assignments.

**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

Computer scientists build solutions that manage, analyze, and present information efficiently, which is vital for business success; work like the CRUD module and dashboard integration directly supports companies such as Grazioso Salvare by streamlining operations, improving decision-making, and enabling them to serve their clients more effectively.
